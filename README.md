# SpecializationProject - 43120

## Description

This project is an application built with Angular for the frontend and Java with Spring for the backend. It utilizes an external API for weather data. The main purpose of the application is to recommend renting a flat or a tent based on the weather conditions.

  ##Angular
Angular is a powerful open-source front-end web development framework created and maintained by Google. It allows developers to build robust and dynamic web applications with ease. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices to simplify the development process and enhance overall productivity.
One of the major advantages of using Angular with Java is the seamless integration and interoperability between the two technologies. Java is a popular and widely adopted programming language for building scalable and enterprise-grade applications. When combined with Angular, Java provides a solid foundation for developing complex web applications.

Backend Compatibility: Java is often used for building robust backend systems, and Angular can seamlessly communicate with Java-based APIs and services through RESTful or GraphQL interfaces. This compatibility allows developers to leverage their existing Java infrastructure and seamlessly integrate it with the frontend, resulting in a unified and cohesive application architecture.
In summary, the combination of Angular and Java offers a powerful and scalable solution for web application development. By leveraging Angular's feature-rich framework and seamless integration with Java, developers can build modern, maintainable, and efficient web applications while leveraging their existing Java knowledge and infrastructure.

  ##Java
  
Java is a versatile and widely used object-oriented programming language that provides developers with a robust platform for building scalable, secure, and cross-platform applications. Known for its "write once, run anywhere" principle, Java enables developers to write code that can be executed on different operating systems without any modifications. With its extensive standard library, automatic memory management, strong community support, and wide range of tools and frameworks, Java has become a popular choice for building a wide variety of applications, from desktop software to enterprise-level systems.
